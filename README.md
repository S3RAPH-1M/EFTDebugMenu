# TestModule - 12.7 R6
Not all maps are currently added because I don't care enough. I mainly used Factory test as it is the fastest map to load (at about 20s) and Customs to test noclip speeds as it is a big fairly open map.

You will need to update references to get it to work with a newer version of SP-Tarkov, I won't spoonfeed you on how to do it.
